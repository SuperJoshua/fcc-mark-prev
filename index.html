# Markdown
## It's like HTML shorthand

- You can make lists
- With two items
- Wait, **three**!
- ...or more

You can quote little `code blocks` and even

```
REALLY
BIG
BLOCKS
of code
```

That wasn't code, of course (in any language that I'm aware of [English isn't *code*]).

> Apparently, this is a block quote.
         
I'm not making this stuff up. Really! [This place](https://help.github.com/en/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) even supports the notion.

Here's an image, for fun:
